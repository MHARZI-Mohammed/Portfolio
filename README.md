## Project overview

This repository contains a small static portfolio site with the following files:

- `index.html` — main HTML page
- `style.css` — styles for the site
- `script.js` — site JavaScript (interactivity)
- `images/` — supporting images

This project is intended as a lightweight personal portfolio/demo you can open locally or host on any static site host.

## Quick start (view locally)

You have two easy options to preview the site on Windows (PowerShell):

1) Open the file directly in your default browser:

```powershell
Start-Process .\index.html
```

2) Run a simple local HTTP server (recommended if your JavaScript expects to be served over HTTP):

```powershell
# If you have Python 3 installed
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
